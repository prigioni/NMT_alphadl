# Transformer neural machine translation model

This sub-repository has implemented three [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) models. 

**V1**, which contains both [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) versions, means simplified Transformer. (Note that here we didn't implement the Beam Search component)

**V2** is highly borrowed from [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py).
